For this project, I've chosen too keep track of how much damage my three D&D groups do over the course of the semester.
I will also keep track of the MVP.


The three groups in question are:
Resurgence (R), What Lies Beyond (WLB) and Watchtower (WT)

Week #1:

	R: 201 Points of Damage (PoD)
	MVP: Kaelyth, Human Ranger - 43 PoD overall
